#🌎Real-World Climate & Ocean Data Projects
Overview
This repository contains applied data analysis and visualization projects focused on climate systems, ocean dynamics, and environmental risk, using real-world observational datasets.

The goal of this repository is to explore how climate and ocean variables—such as storm activity, ocean warming, and atmospheric conditions—interact and impact real communities, particularly in coastal and North American contexts. Emphasis is placed on clear data storytelling, sound methodology, and non-technical interpretability.

📊Current Projects
Atlantic Hurricane Intensity Dashboard (2013–2023)
An interactive dashboard analyzing Atlantic hurricane activity with a focus on storm intensity rather than just frequency.

Key questions explored:
Are hurricanes becoming more frequent?
Are hurricanes becoming stronger?
How does central pressure relate to wind speed?

Key insights:
Storm counts fluctuate year to year without a clear upward trend.
Average maximum wind speeds remain elevated in recent years.
A clear inverse relationship exists between central pressure and wind speed, reinforcing the physical mechanisms behind storm intensification.
Even without record storm counts, stronger storms increase risks of flooding, storm surge, and infrastructure damage.

Tools & methods:
NOAA HURDAT2 hurricane dataset
Data cleaning and aggregation
Looker Studio for visualization
Time-series and relationship analysis
